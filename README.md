# Sovendus App for Shopify

## This documentation is only for the new Shopify version
>
> [!WARNING]
> The Shopify app only works if you have upgraded your thank you / order status page to the "Checkout extensibility" version, the [docs for the old version can be found here](https://developer-hub.sovendus.com/Voucher-Network-Checkout-Benefits/Web-Integration/Shopify-Integration-(old-version))

### How to check if you are using the new Shopify checkout version

To check your thank you / order status page version go to "Settings -> Checkout", if you are on the new version it should look like on the screenshot below:

## Create discount codes in bulk (optional)

If you use the Voucher Network, it's recommended to use a tool to create voucher codes in bulk \
You can use for example [Bulk Discounts](https://apps.shopify.com/bulk-discounts) to create multiple discount codes at once

## 1. Send your Shopify admin URL and color code to Sovendus

a. To generate a installation link, we need the url of your Shopify backend e.g. <https://admin.shopify.com/store/my-store>

b. Get the color code for the buttons on the checkout page

- Go to Settings -> Checkout -> click on Customize to customize your checkout pages
- Click on the gear icon to open the settings sidebar
- Scroll down to the colors section and copy the color code for buttons

c. Send the backend url and color code to Sovendus

## 2. Install the app

Open the installation URL you will receive from Sovendus and click on install

## 3. Configure the App

Go to the Sovendus App and follow the instructions provided in the app

## 4. Test the app

### To test the integration, ensure the following:

- The Shopify App (new version) is not yet recognized by the Self-Test Extension, so no data will be displayed there.

- Instead, verify that the Sovendus integration is visible on the "Thank You" page of your store.

- Ensure that the position of the Sovendus banner matches the position shown in the example image provided below.
