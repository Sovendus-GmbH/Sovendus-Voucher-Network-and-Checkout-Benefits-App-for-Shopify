# Shopify App for Sovendus Voucher Network and Checkout Benefits

## Create discount codes in bulk

If you use the Voucher Network, it's recommended to use a tool to create voucher codes in bulk \
You can use for example [Bulk Discounts](https://apps.shopify.com/bulk-discounts) to create multiple discount codes at once

> [!WARNING]
> The Shopify app only works if you have upgraded your thank you page and order status page to the "Checkout extensibility" version, the docs for the old version can be found here [here](https://github.com/Sovendus-GmbH/Sovendus-Shopify-Voucher-Network-and-Checkout-Benefits-Documentation)
