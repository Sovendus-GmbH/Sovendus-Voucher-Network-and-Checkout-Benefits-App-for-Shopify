# Sovendus App for Shopify

## This documentation is only for the new Shopify version
>
> [!WARNING]
> The Shopify app only works if you have upgraded your thank you / order status page to the "Checkout extensibility" version, the [docs for the old version can be found here](https://developer-hub.sovendus.com/Voucher-Network-Checkout-Benefits/Web-Integration/Shopify-Integration-(old-version))

### How to check if you are using the new Shopify checkout version

To check your thank you / order status page version go to "Settings -> Checkout", if you are on the new version it should look like on the screenshot below:

You can use for example [Bulk Discounts](https://apps.shopify.com/bulk-discounts) to create multiple discount codes at once

- Ensure that the position of the Sovendus banner matches the position shown in the example image provided below.
